Okay, let's craft a detailed Technical Design Specification (TDS) for a "Deep Research" tool, building upon the research paper's findings. This TDS focuses on a Python Gradio-based web UI, offering users a choice between OpenAI-compatible and Google Gemini 2.0 APIs.

**Technical Design Specification: Deep Research Tool**

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the technical design for a Deep Research tool, a web application designed to assist users in conducting in-depth research on a given topic. The tool leverages AI to automate and enhance various stages of the research process, from query analysis and information gathering to knowledge synthesis and report generation. The application will be built using Python, utilizing the Gradio library for the user interface, and will offer flexibility in choosing between OpenAI-compatible and Google Gemini 2.0 APIs for AI processing.

**2. Goals**

*   Provide a user-friendly, intuitive web interface for conducting deep research.
*   Automate key research tasks, such as query expansion, source retrieval, content filtering, and information synthesis.
*   Offer users a choice between OpenAI-compatible and Google Gemini 2.0 APIs for AI processing.
*   Allow users to customize research parameters, including the number of iterations, web searches per iteration, temperature, and maximum tokens for API calls.
*   Deliver synthesized research findings in a clear, organized, and well-attributed manner.
*   Adhere to ethical considerations, including transparency, bias mitigation, and responsible AI practices.

**3. System Architecture**

The system will adopt a modular architecture, comprising the following key components:

*   **Frontend (Gradio Web UI):**  The user interface built with Gradio, providing input fields for the research query, API selection, and other parameters.  It will also display the research progress, intermediate results, and the final synthesized report.
*   **Backend (Python Application):** The core logic of the application, handling user input, orchestrating the research process, interacting with the chosen API, and generating the output.
*   **API Integration Module:**  An abstraction layer that handles communication with either the OpenAI-compatible API or the Google Gemini 2.0 API.  This provides flexibility and allows for easy switching between APIs.
*   **Search Engine Interface:** A module responsible for interacting with search engines (e.g., Google Search, potentially others) to retrieve relevant web pages and content.
*   **Content Processing Module:**  Handles the extraction of text and metadata from retrieved web pages, filtering out irrelevant content.
*   **Knowledge Synthesis Module:**  Analyzes and synthesizes information from multiple sources, identifying themes, contradictions, and key insights.
*   **Report Generation Module:**  Formats the synthesized findings into a structured research report with proper citations.

**4. Data Flow**

1.  **User Input:** The user enters a research query, selects the API (OpenAI or Gemini), and sets parameters (iterations, searches per iteration, temperature, max\_tokens) via the Gradio UI.
2.  **Query Analysis:** The backend receives the user input and performs initial query analysis using NLP techniques (potentially leveraging the chosen API for this step).  This involves identifying key concepts, entities, and the intent of the research question.
3.  **Iterative Research Loop:**  The application enters an iterative loop, performing the following steps for each iteration:
    *   **Query Expansion:** The initial query is expanded into multiple related queries to diversify the search.
    *   **Web Search:** The Search Engine Interface uses the expanded queries to retrieve relevant web pages.
    *   **Content Retrieval and Filtering:**  The Content Processing Module extracts text from the retrieved pages, filtering out irrelevant content and assessing source credibility (using heuristics and potentially API calls).
    *   **API Interaction:**  The API Integration Module sends the filtered content and relevant prompts to the chosen API (OpenAI or Gemini). Prompts will be designed to elicit specific information, such as summaries, key arguments, and relationships between sources.
    *   **Knowledge Synthesis:**  The Knowledge Synthesis Module receives the API's responses and integrates them with information from previous iterations, identifying themes, contradictions, and knowledge gaps.
    *   **Progress Update:** The Gradio UI is updated to display intermediate results and progress to the user.
4.  **Report Generation:**  After the specified number of iterations, the Report Generation Module formats the synthesized findings into a structured report, including citations and a summary.
5.  **Output Display:** The final report is displayed in the Gradio UI.

**5. User Interface (Gradio)**

The Gradio UI will be designed for simplicity and intuitiveness.  Here's a breakdown of the UI elements and example code snippets:

```python
import gradio as gr

def deep_research(query, api_choice, iterations, searches_per_iteration, temperature, max_tokens, openai_api_key, gemini_api_key):
    # ... (Implementation - see Section 6) ...
    return report

with gr.Blocks() as demo:
    gr.Markdown("# Deep Research Tool")
    with gr.Row():
        with gr.Column():
            query = gr.Textbox(label="Research Query", placeholder="Enter your research question here...")
            api_choice = gr.Radio(["OpenAI", "Gemini"], label="API Choice", value="OpenAI")
            with gr.Accordion(label="Advanced Settings"):
                iterations = gr.Slider(label="Number of Iterations", minimum=1, maximum=10, step=1, value=3)
                searches_per_iteration = gr.Slider(label="Web Searches per Iteration", minimum=1, maximum=15, step=1, value=5)
                temperature = gr.Slider(label="Temperature", minimum=0.0, maximum=2.0, step=0.1, value=0.7)
                max_tokens = gr.Number(label="Max Tokens", value=2048)
            openai_api_key = gr.Textbox(label="OpenAI API Key", placeholder="Enter your OpenAI API key (if applicable)...", type="password")
            gemini_api_key = gr.Textbox(label="Gemini API Key", placeholder="Enter your Gemini API key (if applicable)...", type="password")
            submit_button = gr.Button("Start Research")

        with gr.Column():
            report = gr.Textbox(label="Research Report", placeholder="The research report will appear here...", lines=15)
            #Optionally add a progress bar
            #progress_bar = gr.ProgressBar(label="Research Progress")

    submit_button.click(
        deep_research,
        inputs=[query, api_choice, iterations, searches_per_iteration, temperature, max_tokens, openai_api_key, gemini_api_key],
        outputs=report
    )

demo.launch()
```

**Code Explanation:**

*   **`call_openai_api` and `call_gemini_api`:**  Functions to interact with the respective APIs. Note the placeholder for Gemini; adapt it based on the actual Gemini 2.0 API documentation. `call_api` acts as a switcher between the two.
*   **`perform_web_search`:**  Uses the `serpapi` library (you'll need a SerpAPI key) to perform Google searches.  You can adapt this to use other search APIs or libraries.
*   **`extract_text_from_url`:**  Fetches a webpage and extracts the text content using `BeautifulSoup`.  This is a basic example; you'll likely need more sophisticated content extraction techniques for production.
*   **`filter_content`:**  A placeholder for content filtering.  Implement more robust logic here to remove irrelevant content (e.g., ads, navigation menus).
*   **`expand_query`:**  Uses the chosen API to generate a list of related search queries. This is a key part of the diversified search strategy.
*   **`synthesize_information`:**  Combines information from multiple sources and uses the API to generate a synthesis.
*   **`deep_research`:**  The main function that orchestrates the entire research process, implementing the iterative loop described in the Data Flow section. Includes source tracking and iterative synthesis.
* **Environment Variables**: Use environment variables (e.g., `os.environ.get("SERPAPI_API_KEY")`) to store API keys securely, rather than hardcoding them.

**7.  Modules Breakdown and Implementation Details**

*   **7.1 API Integration Module:**
    *   **Purpose:**  Abstracts the API interactions, providing a consistent interface regardless of the chosen API (OpenAI or Gemini).
    *   **Implementation:** The `call_api`, `call_openai_api`, and `call_gemini_api` functions form this module. The key is to design a common input and output format for both APIs, so the rest of the application can interact with this module without needing to know which API is being used.
    *   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling for API calls (e.g., handling rate limits, timeouts, and invalid API keys).
    *   **Asynchronous Calls (Optional):** Consider using asynchronous API calls (e.g., with `aiohttp`) to improve performance, especially when making multiple API requests concurrently.

*   **7.2 Search Engine Interface:**
    *   **Purpose:**  Performs web searches using a chosen search engine (initially Google Search via SerpAPI).
    *   **Implementation:**  The `perform_web_search` function implements this. It takes a query and the number of results as input and returns a list of search results.
    *   **Extensibility:**  Design this module to be easily extensible to support other search engines (e.g., Bing, DuckDuckGo) in the future.  This might involve creating an abstract base class for search engines and concrete implementations for each specific engine.
    *   **API Key Management:** Securely manage API keys (e.g., using environment variables).

*   **7.3 Content Processing Module:**
    *   **Purpose:**  Retrieves and processes web content.
    *   **Implementation:**  `extract_text_from_url` and `filter_content` functions.  This module needs significant improvement for real-world use.
    *   **Advanced Content Extraction:**  Explore libraries like `newspaper3k`, `trafilatura`, or `goose3` for more robust and accurate content extraction. These libraries are designed to extract the main article content from web pages, removing clutter like navigation menus, ads, and comments.
    *   **Content Filtering:** Implement more sophisticated filtering based on:
        *   **Keywords:**  Check for the presence of relevant keywords.
        *   **Sentence Structure:**  Identify and remove short, fragmented sentences or sentences that are likely to be part of navigation menus or ads.
        *   **HTML Structure:** Analyze the HTML structure of the page to identify and remove irrelevant sections.
        *   **Machine Learning:**  Train a machine learning model to classify content as relevant or irrelevant.
    *   **Source Credibility Assessment (Heuristics):** Implement basic heuristics for assessing source credibility, such as:
        *   **Domain Name:**  Check for reputable domain names (e.g., .edu, .gov, .org).
        *   **Presence of Contact Information:** Check for contact information, about us pages, and author information.
        *   **Website Age:**  Consider the age of the website (older websites may be more established).
        *   **HTTPS:** Prioritize websites using HTTPS.
        *   **Combine these heuristics with API calls (using prompts) for better accuracy.**

*   **7.4 Knowledge Synthesis Module:**
    *   **Purpose:**  Analyzes and synthesizes information from multiple sources.
    *   **Implementation:** The `synthesize_information` function.
    *   **Iterative Synthesis:**  The design supports iterative synthesis, where the output of one synthesis round becomes input for the next. This allows the tool to progressively refine its understanding of the topic.
    *   **Prompt Engineering:**  Carefully craft prompts for the synthesis step to elicit the desired information (e.g., key themes, contradictions, insights). Experiment with different prompt formulations to optimize results.
    *   **Advanced Techniques (Future):**  Explore more advanced techniques for knowledge synthesis, such as:
        *   **Knowledge Graph Construction:** Build a knowledge graph to represent relationships between concepts and entities.
        *   **Argumentation Mining:** Identify and extract arguments and counterarguments from different sources.
        *   **Abstractive Summarization:** Use deep learning models to generate concise, abstractive summaries of the research findings.

* **7.5 Report Generation Module:**
    * **Purpose:** Formats the research into a structured report.
    * **Implementation:** The final part of `deep_research`.
    * **Customization:** Consider adding options for users to customize the report format (e.g., choose different citation styles, include or exclude certain sections).
    * **Markdown/HTML Output:** Generate the report in Markdown or HTML format for easy readability and export.

**8. Testing**

*   **Unit Tests:**  Write unit tests for individual functions and modules to ensure they work correctly in isolation.
*   **Integration Tests:** Test the interaction between different modules (e.g., test the flow from query input to report generation).
*   **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):**  Conduct UAT with real users to gather feedback on usability and effectiveness.
*   **API Error Handling Tests:** Specifically test error handling for API calls, ensuring the application gracefully handles issues like rate limits and timeouts.
* **Performance Testing**: Conduct load tests to assess performance under anticipated user load.

**9. Deployment**

*   **Cloud Deployment:**  Deploy the application to a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Heroku) for scalability and accessibility.
*   **Containerization:**  Use Docker to containerize the application, making it easy to deploy and manage.
*   **Web Server:** Use a web server (e.g., Gunicorn, uWSGI) to serve the Gradio application.

**10. Future Enhancements**

*   **Multimodal Support:**  Extend the tool to handle images, videos, and audio content.
*   **Advanced NLP Techniques:** Incorporate more advanced NLP techniques, such as named entity recognition, relation extraction, and sentiment analysis.
*   **Knowledge Graph Integration:**  Build a knowledge graph to represent the relationships between concepts and entities discovered during research.
*   **User Accounts and Personalization:**  Implement user accounts and allow users to save their research projects and preferences.
*   **Collaboration Features:** Allow multiple users to collaborate on research projects.
*   **Automated Citation Management:**  Integrate with citation management tools (e.g., Zotero, Mendeley).
* **Feedback Loop**: Implement a feedback loop to continuously improve the system's performance based on user input.
