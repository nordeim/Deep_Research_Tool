"""
```

This enhanced implementation adds:

1. **Structured Query Analysis**: Uses JSON output for better search planning
2. **Multi-Source Integration**: Supports academic and news APIs
3. **Semantic Clustering**: Groups content by topic similarity
4. **Thematic Synthesis**: Generates cluster-based summaries
5. **Advanced Citation Handling**: Style-formatted references
6. **Interactive Visualization**: Topic cluster visualization
7. **Quality Metrics**: Combines credibility, freshness, and relevance scores
8. **Bias Detection**: Flags potential biases during analysis

To use this effectively:
1. Add API keys for additional services (SerpAPI, NewsAPI)
2. Implement visualization components for topic clusters
3. Add error handling wrappers for external services
4. Include rate limiting and cost management
5. Add user authentication for enterprise use

The system now better addresses core research requirements through structured analysis, multi-perspective synthesis, and improved source evaluation while maintaining usability through enhanced interface components.

You are a deep thinking AI, you may use extremely long chains of thought to deeply consider the problem and deliberate with yourself via systematic reasoning processes to help come to a correct solution prior to answering. You will think deeply and thoroughly to explore various implementation options before choosing the most optimal one. You will double-check and validate any code changes before implementing. You should enclose your thoughts and internal monologue inside <think> </think> tags, and then provide your solution or response to the problem.

*Your task:* dive deep into how an ideal deep research tool should function, explore the sample code pasted below, and then create an improved version. Use the steps below as your guiding methodology.

Explore how an ideal deep research tool should work, breakdown the core aspects of effective research procedures down systematically:

1. Query analysis and planning
2. Search methodology and web crawling
3. Content evaluation and extraction
4. Information synthesis and summarization
5. Citation and sourcing
6. User experience considerations

You will explore best practices and potential improvements.

A good deep research tool should function through these key steps:

1. **Query Analysis**: First understand the research question's scope, identify key concepts, and develop a structured research plan.

2. **Diversified Search Strategy**: Generate multiple search queries approaching the topic from different angles to overcome search engine biases and capture diverse perspectives.

3. **Intelligent Content Retrieval**: Prioritize authoritative sources while filtering out low-quality content, and handle various content formats effectively.

4. **Contextual Understanding**: Recognize the relevance of information to the research question, extracting meaningful insights rather than just text.

5. **Synthesis and Organization**: Organize findings thematically rather than just by source, identifying patterns, contradictions, and knowledge gaps.

6. **Iterative Refinement**: Use initial findings to inform subsequent searches, progressively diving deeper into the topic.

7. **Clear Attribution**: Maintain transparent source tracking with proper citations throughout the research process.

## Check the current implementation for its strengths as well as for the following limitations:

- **Basic Query Processing**: No structured analysis of the initial research question
- **Limited Search Strategy**: Simple Google searches without filtering for source quality
- **Minimal Content Evaluation**: No prioritization of sources by relevance or credibility
- **Basic Summarization**: Simplistic content synthesis without thematic organization
- **Incomplete Citation**: URLs are included but without proper attribution
- **Error Handling**: Some basic handling but needs improvement for robustness
- **Interface**: The Gradio interface is incomplete in the provided code

## Creating an Improved Implementation

Based on the above analysis, create an enhanced version of the deep research tool with significant improvements in each area.
