Okay, let's start by understanding what the user is asking for. They provided a Python script for a deep research tool and want an improved version based on the analysis of its current limitations. The task is to enhance the tool by addressing the listed shortcomings in areas like query analysis, search strategy, content evaluation, summarization, citations, error handling, and user experience.

First, I need to review the existing code to identify where the limitations are. The current implementation has basic query processing without structured analysis. The search strategy uses simple Google searches without filtering for quality. Content evaluation is minimal, and summarization is too basic. Citations are just URLs without proper attribution, error handling needs improvement, and the Gradio interface is incomplete.

So, the plan is to enhance each of these areas step by step. Let's start with query analysis. The current code has an analyze_research_query function, but maybe it's not comprehensive enough. I should add more structured analysis, perhaps breaking down the query into subtopics and identifying key concepts. Using an LLM to generate a detailed research plan makes sense here.

Next, the search strategy. The tool generates multiple queries, but maybe they're not diverse enough. The generate_search_queries function could be improved by incorporating different angles and perspectives. Also, integrating a credibility check for domains would help prioritize authoritative sources. The existing CREDIBILITY_RATINGS is a start, but maybe expanding it or using a more dynamic method would be better.

For content evaluation, the extract_relevant_content function calculates relevance and credibility scores. But perhaps the scoring could be more nuanced, considering factors like publication date, author expertise, or cross-referencing with other sources. Also, handling different content formats like PDFs or videos might be necessary, but the current code filters out some formats. Maybe adding support for those, or at least better handling of excluded formats.

Summarization needs thematic organization instead of just listing sources. The generate_content_summary function should group information by themes, highlight consensus and contradictions, and evaluate evidence strength. Using the LLM to structure the summary with clear sections would help here.

Citations are currently just URLs. The tool should track sources throughout the process and provide proper citations, maybe in APA or MLA format. The metadata collected during scraping includes URLs and timestamps, which can be formatted into citations. Adding a citation generation function would address this.

Error handling in the existing code has retries and exponential backoff, but maybe adding more specific exception handling and user-friendly error messages would improve robustness. Also, logging could be enhanced to help diagnose issues.

The Gradio interface is incomplete. The user mentioned it's incomplete, so adding more features like progress indicators, a history of past queries, or a way to download the report would enhance UX. Also, input validation to ensure required fields are filled could prevent errors.

Testing each component is crucial. After making changes, I need to ensure that the enhanced functions work as intended without introducing new bugs. Maybe adding unit tests for critical functions like query generation, content scraping, and summarization would help.

Finally, integrating all these improvements into the existing codebase while maintaining readability and structure. Refactoring some parts for better modularity, adding comments, and documentation would make the code easier to maintain and extend in the future.

Wait, the user also mentioned using crawl4ai for web scraping. The current code uses AsyncWebCrawler from crawl4ai, which is good, but maybe checking if it handles JavaScript-rendered pages or if additional configurations are needed for better content extraction. Also, rate limiting and respecting robots.txt could be important for ethical scraping.

Another thought: the tool uses both OpenAI and Gemini models. Maybe adding a fallback mechanism if one API fails, or allowing the user to choose based on cost or performance preferences. Also, handling API keys securely, maybe through environment variables as done, but ensuring they're properly loaded and validated.

In the Gradio interface, maybe adding a preview of the URLs being scraped or a summary of sources before the full report is generated. Also, allowing users to adjust parameters dynamically, like changing the depth during the process, but that might complicate the interface.

I should also consider performance optimizations. The current code uses concurrent scraping and async functions, which is good. Maybe implementing caching for previously scraped URLs to avoid redundant requests and speed up subsequent searches on the same topic.

Lastly, ensuring that the tool adheres to ethical guidelines, especially regarding data privacy and source attribution. Making sure that the scraping doesn't violate any websites' terms of service and that all sources are properly credited in the final report.
